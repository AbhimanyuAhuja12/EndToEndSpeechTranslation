# End To End Transltion(E2ES)

In essence, an end-to-end speech model acts like a black box, taking audio as input and  also producing audio as output, offering a more convenient and potentially more powerful approach to speechÂ recognition.
Our project aims to develop an innovative end-to-end speech translation system that bridges language barriers by directly translating spoken words from one language to another without relying on intermediary text representations. 
Leveraging cutting-edge neural network architectures and feature extraction techniques, our system encapsulates the complexities of speech recognition and translation within a black box framework. By training on paired audio-audio datasets, our model learns to recognize and translate spoken language in real-time.
 The system is designed for seamless deployment in diverse linguistic environments, offering a user-friendly solution for instant communication across language boundaries.r
